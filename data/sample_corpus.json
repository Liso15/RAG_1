Step 3 - Execute 'sudo systemctl restart apache2'. Step 4 - Monitor logs for 5 minutes using 'tail -f /var/log/apache2/error.log'. Step 5 - Verify service status with 'systemctl status apache2'. Expected downtime: 30-60 seconds. Critical: Never restart during peak hours (9AM-5PM EST)."

Command sequence: 'sudo systemctl stop all-services && sudo shutdown -h +1'. Always backup current state first using automated scripts in /opt/backup/. Contact on-call engineer immediately. Document incident in PagerDuty with full timeline. Recovery time typically 15-30 minutes depending on data integrity checks."
